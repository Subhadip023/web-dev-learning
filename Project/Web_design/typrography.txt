Script fonts (e.g., Brush Script) can evoke elegance, creativity, and femininity.
Bold fonts convey strength, importance, and confidence.
Italic fonts can imply movement, emphasis, and informality.
Overall, font choice can significantly impact how a message is perceived emotionally, influencing the reader's interpretation and engagement.
